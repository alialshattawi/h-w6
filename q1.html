1. Which of the following statements will potentially execute? And give values for A, B and C that will make the statement execute:
    if A is true AND B is true AND C is true THEN color="blue"
    
    
    else if A is true AND B is false AND C is false THEN color="red"
    this statement will execute
    
    else if A is true AND A is false THEN color="orange"
    it will not execute becouse A has two diffrent values
    
    else if A is true AND B is false AND C is true THEN color="green"
    this statement will execute
    
    else color="yellow"
    else if A is false AND B is false AND C is false THEN color="yellow"
