Which of the following statements will potentially execute? And give values for A, B and C that will make the statement execute:
    if A is true OR A is false OR B is true OR C is true THEN color="blue"
    
    else if A is true OR B is false OR C is false THEN color="red"
    it will not execute becouse A is true in statement 1
    
    else if A is true OR B is false OR C is true THEN color="green"
    it will not execute 
    
    
    else color="yellow"
    it will not execute because the value A true or false will give me the statement 1
